# Contributions welcome!
Whilst any help is very special, please be considerate of certain rules in order to make the codebase uniform and coherent.

### Formatting rules
- When using a `require()` statement, use single quotes. For example:
  ```lua
    require('neorg.modules.base')
  ```
- Use double quotes `"` eveywhere else. For example:
  ```lua
    local module = neorg.modules.create("core.mymodulename")
  ```
  
### Coding style
- I use snake_case for everything, and you should too :P
- **Please** comment all your code! Documenation for functions is generated by [prodoc.nvim](https://github.com/glepnir/prodoc.nvim).

### Modules
- When creating a module, add a comment up top as seen [here](/lua/neorg/modules/core/autocommands/module.lua) and [here](/lua/neorg/modules/core/keybinds/module.lua)
- Add a general description of what the module does at the top and provide a `USAGE:` block describing how to use the module

## Adding functionality
Whenever you are planning on extending neorg, try your best to add *all* extra functionality through modules and modules only. Make changes to the neorg core only if absolutely necessary.
When adding stuff, use lua only. `vim.cmd` in extreme cases :)

### Ideas for modules if you don't have any:
- [ ] A `core.norg` module to read, parse and convert .norg files into a sort of syntax tree (currently being worked on)
- [ ] A utility module to add wrap several monotonous functions
- [ ] A module to simplify interactions and manipulation of text, something really important for a plugin like neorg :)
